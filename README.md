# Virtual Assistant Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Virtual Assistant project! This personal assistant, developed using Python, is designed to enhance productivity and efficiency by managing tasks, setting reminders, and providing real-time information through natural language interactions.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understands and responds to user queries using libraries such as NLTK and spaCy.
- **Voice Recognition and Synthesis:** Implements SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 for seamless voice interaction.
- **Task Management:** Assists in managing daily tasks, setting reminders, and keeping track of schedules.
- **Integration with Services:** Connects with calendar, email, and other task management services through API integrations.
- **Machine Learning:** Continuously learns from user interactions to improve response accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-assistant.git
    cd virtual-assistant
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the virtual assistant:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Interact with the assistant using voice commands or text inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **NLP Libraries:** NLTK, spaCy
- **Voice Interaction:** SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3
- **APIs:** Integrated with calendar, email, and task management services
- **Machine Learning:** Various algorithms to improve response accuracy
